### About


Blackbox for Windows is based stylistically on the [Blackbox](http://blackboxwm.sourceforge.net/) window manager for the X Window System by Brad Hughes, however it does not use the same codebase except for the gradient rendering code.\

The foundation of Blackbox for Windows is full cross-platform support\

A theme (or style as it is called in *nix) can be taken directly from *nix and used in Windows with little or no difference in appearance
this means - unlike most other shells - themes don't have to be custom created for the shell

### Configuration

I did some minor configurations to make it look as simple as possible.\

I wanted to include a screenshot of how would it look like with the configuration applied but sady I switched to MacOs.\
Maybe I revisit the configuration sometime in future using Bootcamp or just a VM.\

If you want to use this repo just clone it.
